# Savings_App
My Savings App for iOS

# Description
This is a project I'm creating for myself at first place. I'm building an application to help myself with daily expenses setting a daily budget trying to
not going over it. The App is gonna allow the user to insert goals in the form of objects or travels or whatever we are trying to save money for
keeping track of how much we need to save and how many days left to reach our goal (when we actually are going to be able to buy them).
